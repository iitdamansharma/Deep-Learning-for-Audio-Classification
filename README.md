# Bird_CLEF_2024-main

This project is focused on bird call classification using various machine learning techniques and neural network architectures. The project includes multiple Jupyter notebooks for different stages of data processing, model training, and inference.

## Project Files
- `birdclef-inference-mel-spec-for-ensemble.ipynb`: Notebook for inference using mel spectrograms for ensemble learning.
- `birfclefdatalist.ipynb`: Data list creation notebook for BirdCLEF dataset.
- `effvitfinal2steptrain.ipynb`: Notebook for 2-step training using EfficientViT model.
- `effvitmel.ipynb`: Notebook for training with mel spectrograms using EfficientViT model.
- `nonpadinfer.ipynb`: Notebook for non-padding inference.
- `simclr-on-unlabel.ipynb`: Notebook for SimCLR on unlabelled data.
- `specs-creation-bird-clef.ipynb`: Notebook for creating spectrograms for BirdCLEF dataset.
- `training-bird-clef.ipynb`: Main training notebook for the BirdCLEF dataset.
